        "\n",
        "   Python uses OOPs.\n",
        "   The key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming are given below:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Classes and Objects:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Class:**  It defines the attributes and methods that objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object:** An instance of the class. It represents a unique entity with class-defined attributes and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of binding data and methods together into a single entity, i.e., a class. It prevents direct access to certain parts of the object and ensures controlled interaction with object data through various methods. This is key to maintaining the integrity of the object state in.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ways in which a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. This encourages reuse of rules and increased correlation between classes. A subclass can also collapse or extend the functionality of its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of hiding complex user information about an object and revealing only the essential features. An abstraction class allows a simplified interface to expose and hide trivial information, focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. This helps reduce complexity and allows the code to be reused.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ability to treat classes as instances of the same class using common interfaces. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method calls in ways specific to their classes, providing flexibility and the ability to use a single interface for multiple data types or classes\n",
        "For Example: calling method and overriding method.\n",
