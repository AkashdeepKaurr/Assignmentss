    "**1.Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is interpreted high level programming language. Python was developed by Guido van Rossum and was first launched in 1991. It is beginner and developer friendly in nature due to its features. \n",
    "The features of Python are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) Easy to Learn**\n",
    "     Everyone can learn Python, because it is not necessary to know any base language, such as C, beforehand. The syntex of Python is very easy as it eliminates the requirement for writing library files, main functions and other functions; we only need to write what we need. Moreover we do not need to declare datatype for a variable. Due to its huge number of libraries developers can more focus on solving problems rather then tangled in language specifics.\n",
    "     For Example: \n",
    "                     print(\"This is my first assignment\")\n",
    "\n",
    "We only need to write one line of code in order to print one line. However, we must write at least 7-8 lines of code in other languages.\n",
    "This makes Python easy to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b) Vast Libraries**\n",
    "     Python has variety of in built libraries that can be used by many different fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "     For example: SciPy, Matplotlib libraries are used to do Scientific computing.\n",
    "                  Data science and machine learning can also be done using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.\n",
    "                  Game development can be done using libraries like Pygame.\n",
    "                  Python can even communicate with Arduino using pySerial, pyFirmata, arduino-cli and ino libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c) Versatility and Wide Application**\n",
    "     Python is really a versatile language because Python has easy syntax anyone can learn easily and its libraries make it wide application.\n",
    "     From basic coding to AI, ML and NLP can be done using Python. many fields are covered in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "**d)  Data Science and Machine Learning**\n",
    "      Python's ability to process and analyze data makes it the most popular language for data research.\n",
    "      We utilize libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to execute out data science operations.\n",
    "      The libraries mentioned above are used for:   Data exploration and Data Analysis.\n",
    "                                                    Testing hypotheses and statistical models.\n",
    "                                                    Making visual representations of data.\n",
    "                                                    Utilizing extensive data pipelines and databases.\n",
    "      These libraries are used in the domains of finance, healthcare, marketing, and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "      For instance, using Matplotlib to create charts and plots and Pandas to manage and analyze huge datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**e) Extensive Tooling and Automation**\n",
    "     Python can automaticall generate reports, documents and PDFs using ReportLab, Jinja2, XlxsWriter libraries. \n",
    "     Moreover it can generate dynamic HTML sheets automatically. Due to this reason Python is widely used for tooling and Automation. \n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "**f) Community and Support**\n",
    "     Among all other languages Python has strong and huge community support.\n",
    "     Many developers are fixing bugs and updating tools in Python on daily basis.\n",
    "     Python is famous because it is conducting many conferences and local meetups to build network, code and learn."

    "2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Keywords are predefined in Python. They have some special roles for specific tasks. There are total 33 Keyboards in Python. They are also called as reserve words. They can't be used as identifiers for variable names, function names and many other user defined entities in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Keywords in Python are\n",
    "    False, class, finally, is, return, None, continue, for, lambda, try, True, def, from, nonlocal, while, and, del, global, not, with, as, elif, if, or, yield, assert, else, import, pass, break, except, in raise.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "   Roles of predefined keywords in Python are given below:\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **Control flow:**\n",
    "   Python have some control flow keywords that manage the flow of execution in a program which means they take decisions from start of the program to end of the program whether the condition falls on first command to last. The keywords used in control flow are if, else, elif, for, while, break, and continue.\n",
    "   \r",
    "    For Example:\n",
    "    number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    factorial= 1\n",
    "    if number < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"Factorial doesnot exist for negative numbers\")\n",
    "    elif number == 0:\n",
    "        print(\"The factorial of 0 is 1\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        for i in range(1, number+1):\n",
    "        factorial = factorial*i\n",
    "    print (\"The factorial of a number is: \" factorial)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Function Definition:**\n",
    "    We can define functions in Python using keywords and we can also get return values from them. Function defining keywords are def, return, yield and lambda.\n",
    "   For Example:\n",
    "   def add_numbers(a,b):\n",
    "       return a+b\n",
    "   result = add_numbers(5,8)\n",
    "   print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **OOPs:**\n",
    "    Python uses Object Oriented Programming concept. We can create classes and objects easily with real world entities. So, we can say everything in  Python is an object. Keywords like class, self, __init__ and square are related to objects and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Exception Handling:**\n",
    "    While executing a program, sometimes an unexpected error occurs (Like dividing anumber by zero) and we call it an exception.\n",
    "                            Keywords for handling these exceptions are try, expect, finally, raise and assert.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Boolean Operations:**\n",
    "    In Python we can compare operations weather the condition is true or false using boolean logics (True/False). We use some keyboards like AND, OR, NOT, True, False and None for conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "     **Context Management:**\n",
    "     Context mangagers basically work with resources. It manages files and network connection so that it can look them efficiently. Whether error occurs or any exception occurs it allocates the resources well. We an perform context management with teh help of with and as keywords.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     **Importing Modules:**\n",
    "     Modules are in which python functions, classes etc are being imported. So that it can be reused repeatedly in the same or another python program.       We can Import modules with the help of Import, math and from keywords.d     in Importing     modules.\r\n",
    "F    or Example:\r\n",
    "import mat    h\r\n",

    "   Assignment Operators\n",
    "   Membership Operators\n",
    "   Identity Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Arithmetic Operators:**\n",
    "   These are used to make basic mathematics operations like addition(+), substraction(-), Divide(/), Modulus(%), Multiplication(*), Floor(//) and Power(**).\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example:\n",

We can perform equal to(==), not equal to(!=), greater than equal to(>=), less than equal to(<=), greater than(>), less than(<) operations. If the conditions matches then it will return True value other wise it will return False value.\n",
