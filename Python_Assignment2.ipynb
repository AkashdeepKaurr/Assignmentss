        "\n",
        "   In Python, a list is a built-in data structure that is used to store an ordered collection of items. Lists can hold items of any data type (such as integers, strings, or even other lists), and they are one of the most versatile and widely-used data structures in Python.\n",
        "   Key features of lists are given below:\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Ordered Collection:**\n",
        "   A list keeps things in the same order as we add them. If we put \"apple\" first and then \"banana,\" it will remain as it is.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   For Example:\n",
        "   fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"mango\"]\n",
        "   Apple is at index 0, banana is at index 1 and mango is at index 2.\n",

        "   **Mutable:**\n",
        "   we can even change elements of the list after creating the list.\n",
        "   Let's change mango with orange.\n",

        "   For Example:\n",
        "   fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"mango\"]\n",
        "   fruits[2] = \"orange\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Dynamic Size:**\n",
        "   We are able to increase the decrease the length of lists.\n",
        "   We can add and delete elements from a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "   append() and extend() methods are used to add elements in a list.\n",
        "   remove() and pop() elements are used to remove elements in a list.\n",

        "   fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"mango\"]\n",
        "   fruits.append(\"orange\")\n",
        "   It will add orange at index 3 in a list.\n",
        "\n",

        "   List can contain hetrogeneous data. Which means we can add elements of different data types in a single list.\n",

        "   For Example:\n",
        "   a = [\"Hello\", 987654, 3+5j, 247.33]\n",

        "   **List under a list**\n",
        "   We can create number of lists under a single list.\n",

        "   For Example:\n",
        "   a = [[\"This is list under a list\"], [\"This is index 1\"], [\"We can create various elemnts in a single list.\"]]\n",
        "\n",

        "   **Immutable**\n",
        "   Tuples are immutable, brcause once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "   For Example:\n",
        "   c = (54. 58.58, \"Python\")\n",
        "   c(0) = 100 //It will show error because tuples can not change it's elements value.\n",

        "   Tuples have fewer methods because they cannot be modified. Common tuple methods include count() and index().\n",

        "   **Key Reasons for Dictionary Keys Being Immutable:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Hashing and Lookup Efficiency:**\n",
        "   Dictionaries use a hash table under the hood to store key-value pairs. Each key is hashed, and the hash value determines the location to store the value associated with the key.\n",
        "   If the key had to be changed, its hash value may change if the key itself was changed. This would compromise the dictionary’s ability to find the key efficiently, as it relies on the key hash to retrieve it.  \n",
        "\n",
        "   **Consistency and Integrity:**\n",
        "   Immutability ensures that the key remains consistent throughout its life in the dictionary. If the key is to be changed, and changed after it is added to the dictionary, the mapping between the key and its value will not match, leading to possible unpredictable results\n",
        "\n",
        "   For example, if you change the key, the dictionary will not know how to find the associated value because the original hash (from the unmodified key) will no longer be valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Avoiding Errors:**\n",
        "   Allowing mutable keys could lead to subtle and difficult-to-debug errors. For instance, modifying a key that is already in the dictionary would make it impossible to access the associated value, but the key would still exist in the dictionary in some form.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Examples**\n",
        "\n",
        "   **1. Valid Dictionary Keys: Immutable Types**\n",
        "   Integers and strings are common immutable types that can be used as dictionary keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "   For Example:\n",
        "   d = {\n",
        "    1: 'apple',\n",
        "    'name': 'John',\n",
        "    (1, 2, 3): 'coordinates'\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   In the example above, integers, strings, and tuples (containing immutable elements) are used as dictionary keys because they are all immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **2. Invalid Dictionary Keys: Mutable Types**\n",
        "   The characters are interchangeable and cannot be used as dictionary keys. Attempting to do so raises a TypeError.\n",
        "\n",
        "   l = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   d = {\n",
        "   l: 'invalid key'  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   Lists can be modified spatially (e.g., to add, remove, or modify items), which makes it difficult for the dictionary to rely on the hash value of the key to store or retrieve values\n",
        "\n",
        "   **3. Mutability**\n",
        "   For Example:\n",
        "   l = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   d = {my_list: 'value'}\n",
